# Cliper [![GoDoc Widget]][walker]

> Light clipboard manager from the command line

**Cliper** allows you to get back in your clipboard what you copied
earlier. It can become handy when you need to recall a command you
needed a few minutes ago, or go to an url you pasted in the morning for
example.


## Usage

**Cliper** works in client/server mode : a server watches the clipboard
and stores its history, while you can query it from the client.

Typically you will want to fire the server as a startup daemon and
forget about it, and only uses the client when needed

**This is only tested on MacOSX for now, but it could work elsewhere**

```Bash
$ # monitor the clipboard
$ cliper \
  -db /tmp/clip.db \  # where to store the data
  -refresh 1s      \  # how long between polling clipboard update
  -reset           \  # start with a fresh history
  watch               # the command to trigger server mode
```

Then go ctrl-c some stuff and interact with your clipboard history.

```Bash
$ # inspect the history
$ cliper \
  -db /tmp/clip.db \  # make sure to point on the same DB (or use default)
  ls
